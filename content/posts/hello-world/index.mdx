Writing was on my list of new year resolutions. Though we're 7 months into year, I figured it's still not too late to start.
Recently, I've been interested in topics around software design patterns and architecture. As I read about topics around these terminologies,
I will be putting together my learnings on the various topics and make them available via these blog posts.

There are definitely great resources out there around these topics and great books like Design Patterns, Designing Data-Intensive Applications
and the like which provide great insights. Martin Fowler's website is also a great place I've been reading about these topics.

My goal is to first use these articles as a form of structuring my learning around the various topics with the added benefits
of making them available for other engineers to read.

Hopefully, this will not be the only blog post I write this year ðŸ˜…

See you in my next post!
